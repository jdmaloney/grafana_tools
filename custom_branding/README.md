# Grafana Custom Branding

Script/Example Image files to apply a Custom Branding makeover for your organization

This is configured to work with Grafana v12.1.0+ (see earlier commit for a pre v12.1.0 version of the script)

A few notes:
* Images provides are examples, replace with your own
  * Match file types always
  * Match resolutions on non svg files
* Fill in your title and subtitle in the config file
* Back up your /usr/share/grafana/public directory for safe keeping before running
* This should be run after every update of Grafana
